                <ul>
                    <li>All 4 members of the group have been 100% active during this sprint.</li>

                </ul>

            <li>Who did what, during this sprint?
                <ul>
                    <li>We have all 4 been involved in every single step together during this sprint. We have taken turns at being the one who does the coding and at being copilots. This has worked perfectly during the first iteration as this sprint solely entailed set up of the overall system and therefore was not obvious to divide between us. We have also been able to solve issues quickly with the shared amount of knowledge between all of us - there was always at least 1 person who remembered an important detail from class or previous projects, that was the key to the solution. This has made the sprint run smooth and fast from beginning till end.</li>
